#Objective
#This project automates the 'Beauty & Wellness' section on the Naaptol website using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It includes test cases written in TestNG and integrates with Maven for build management and Extent Reports for test reporting.

#Key Features

Page Object Model: Enhances test maintenance and reduces code duplication by separating the test logic from the UI elements.
Assertions: Validates the test results to ensure the application behaves as expected.
Screenshots: Captures screenshots for test failures.
Property File Reading: Fetches configuration data like URLs, browser types, and credentials dynamically.
Waits: Implements explicit waits to handle synchronization issues in web elements.
Maven Integration: Manages dependencies and test execution.
GitHub Repository: Enables version control and collaboration.
